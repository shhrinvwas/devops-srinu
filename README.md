Sure, I can help you convert the provided Node.js code into a Python script and explain each step. To achieve this, we'll use the following libraries:

requests for making HTTP requests.
azure-devops library for Azure DevOps API access.
Here's the Python code equivalent to the provided Node.js code:

-

Let's break down the Python code step by step:

We import the necessary libraries, including requests for HTTP requests and the azure-devops library for Azure DevOps API access.

Replace the organization_url and personal_access_token variables with your Azure DevOps organization URL and personal access token.

We define the run function, which is similar to the Node.js run function. It retrieves all teams in the organization and constructs a dictionary of teams based on the project.

In the construct_teams function, we iterate through the teams and make an HTTP GET request to retrieve team permissions using the team's ID and project ID. We also retrieve team members and construct a dictionary of team names and their members.

Finally, we print the resulting organization structure.

In the if __name__ == "__main__": block, we run the run function using asyncio to ensure asynchronous execution.

Make sure to install the required Python packages (requests, azure-devops), and replace the placeholders with your actual Azure DevOps organization URL and personal access token.
